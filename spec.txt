The task is to plan and create a simple web application, using Laravel. This coursework involves writing
part-of the back-end of that web application.
There is a total of 50 marks available for this coursework. This coursework is worth 15% of your total
grade for this module.
The web application should have the following basic functionality:
1. Users can create posts and comment on their own and other users’ posts.
2. Basic analytics is displayed for posts, for example number of unique views.
You could create a simple blog where the admin can post articles which users can comment on, or a
simple version of canvas where admin (or lecturers) can post lecture slides and students can comment on
them. This is the basic functionality only; it is up to you to look at the mark scheme and
add functionality to evidence various skills. Plan this before you start.
Each user has the following information associated with them:
• ID
• First Name
• Last Name
• Adminstrator flag (true if they are an administrator, false if not)
Your Task
Your job is to create the various migrations, models, seeds and model factories. Your seeds and model
factories must populate the database with random and meaningful values broadly covering all possible
scenarios. Your seeds and model factories must also create some fixed and stable values (at least one
adminstrator, one user, etc).
Marking Scheme
Marks are allocated as follows:
• Migrations - 10 marks
• Models - 8 marks
• Seeds - 14 marks
• Model Factories - 8 marks
• Basic Analytics - 10 marks
The marks will be awarded based on the functionality and quality of each category above. For example ,
seeds must populate the database with random data that covers all situations. Please see the rubric for
coursework 1 for a better breakdown of marks.
